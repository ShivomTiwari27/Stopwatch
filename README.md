# Stopwatch Application

## Overview

### The challenge
The challenge was to create a functional stopwatch that allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer with a user-friendly interface. The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on accurate time tracking and user interaction.

## My process

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

### What I learned
This project helped me improve my understanding of JavaScript, particularly in working with timing functions like `setInterval` and `clearInterval`. Here's a breakdown of what I learned:

#### Using `setInterval` and `clearInterval`
These functions are crucial for creating a stopwatch. `setInterval` repeatedly calls a function at specified intervals, which is essential for updating the display every millisecond.

```javascript
function start() {
  if (!running) {
    startTime = Date.now() - elapsedTime;
    timer = setInterval(update, 10);
    running = true;
  }
}

function stop() {
  if (running) {
    clearInterval(timer);
    elapsedTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    running = false;
  }
}
```
In this snippet:

- `start()` begins the timer by setting the `startTime` and using `setInterval` to call the `update()` function every 10 milliseconds.
- `stop()` pauses the timer by clearing the interval and calculating the elapsed time.
- Formatting Time
- To ensure the time is displayed correctly, I used `Math.floor()` to calculate hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, and `String.padStart()` to format them into a consistent 2-digit format:

```javascript
let hours = Math.floor(elapsedTime / (1000 * 60 * 60));
let minute = Math.floor(elapsedTime / (1000 * 60) % 60);
let seconds = Math.floor(elapsedTime / 1000 % 60);
let millisecond = Math.floor(elapsedTime % 1000 / 10);

hours = String(hours).padStart(2, 0);
minute = String(minute).padStart(2, 0);
seconds = String(seconds).padStart(2, 0);
millisecond = String(millisecond).padStart(2, 0);

display.textContent = `${hours}:${minute}:${seconds}:${millisecond}`;

```

This approach ensures the time is always displayed as `HH:MM:SS:MS`, even when values are less than 10.

## Continued development

In future projects, Iâ€™d like to:
- Add a lap functionality to record intermediate times.
- Improve the UI by adding animations and sound effects for the start, stop, and reset actions.
- Implement a more advanced timing system that includes different time units like days or weeks.

## Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) - This helped me understand how to execute functions at regular intervals.
- [MDN Web Docs - Date.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now) - This was essential for capturing the current time in milliseconds.
